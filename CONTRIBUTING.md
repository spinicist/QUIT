# Contributing to QUIT

Welcome to QUIT. Any help is very much appreciated.

These guidelines exist to make it easy to get involved and ensure that QUIT is welcoming to everyone.

## Asking Questions / Reporting Bugs

If you have general questions about how to use QUIT programs, you can either open an [issue](https://github.com/spinicist/QUIT/issues) or ask a question on [Neurostars](https://neurostars.org).

If you think you have found a bug, then opening a Github issue is the preferred avenue. Please check whether an identical or similar issue already exists first. When opening a new issue, please give as much information as you can, including
- The version of QUIT you are using. Either give the version number if you downloaded the binaries, or a branch/git commit id if you compiled from source.
- The operating system you are running on.
- A description of the bug, including the full shell command you ran and any input files.

## Contributing Changes

If you want to edit the QUIT code yourself to fix a problem or implement a new feature, you are very welcome to! To do so, please:
1. Open an issue on the [QUIT Github page](https://github.com/spinicist/QUIT/issues)
2. Follow the [Forking workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow) to fix the issue. 

To date, QUIT has one main developer (@spinicist). Hence the above is a suggested model for how changes can be contributed, and will be edited if and when a better model is suggested.

QUIT currently has a fairly loose coding style, in part because it uses several libraries with conflicting coding style. @spinicist prefers the following style at present, but will allow some flexibility (except as noted in the first point):
- Kernigan & Ritchie braces convention. Please do not use the GNU Coding Style braces convention as demonstrated in ITK.
- Classes and global functions should be Capitalised. Local variables should begin with a lower-case letter. Private/protected member variables should begin with `m_`, public member variables do not have to follow this to make the interface clearer.
- Camel case or `under_scores` are both acceptable as your whims dictate.
- Spaces, not tabs. If you find some tabs in one of the older files please let @spinicist know and we can decide what to do about them.

## Code of Conduct

- Anyone who participates in the development of QUIT is expected to show respect and courtesy to all other community members at all times.
- Harrasment in any form towards any members will not be tolerated.
- All communication should be appropraite for a professional audience including people of different backgrounds.
- Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other contributers.

## Thanks

Above all, thank you for using or contributing to QUIT. It really is appreciated.
