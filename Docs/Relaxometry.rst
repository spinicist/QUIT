Relaxometry
===========

Relaxometry is the measurement of the longitudinal and transverse relaxation times T1 and T2. There are a multitude of different techniques for measuring both. The main focus of QUIT has been on the Driven-Equilibrium Single-Pulse Observation of T1 (DESPOT1) family of techniques, but the classic multi-echo T2 method and the more recent MP2RAGE T1 measurement method are also implemented. It is common for relaxometry methods to need a :doc:`B1` map.

The following commands are available:

* `qi despot1`_
* `qi despot1hifi`_
* `qi despot2`_
* `qi despot2fm`_
* `qi jsr`_
* `qi mcdespot`_
* `qi multiecho`_
* `qi mp2rage`_
* `qi mpm_r2s`_
* `qi ssfp_ellipse`_
* `qi planet`_
* `qi irtse` _

qi despot1
---------

This command implements the classic Driven Equilibrium Single-Pulse Observation of T1 (DESPOT1) algorithm, also known as the Variable Flip-Angle (VFA) method in the literature. This is a fast way to measure longitudinal relaxation using a spoiled steady-state sequence, which is know by a different name by every scanner manufacturer just to be helpful. On GE, it's SPoiled Gradient Recalled echo (SPGR), on Siemens it's Fast Low-Angle SHot (FLASH) and on Phillips the sequence is Fast Field Echo (FFE).

**Example Command Line**

.. code-block:: bash

    qi despot1 input_file.nii.gz --mask=mask_file.nii.gz --B1=b1_file.nii.gz < input.json

**Example JSON File**

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "SPGR": {
            "TR": 0.01,
            "FA": [3, 18]
        }
    }

**Outputs**

* ``D1_T1.nii.gz`` - The T1 map. Units are the same as those used for TR in the input.
* ``D1_PD.nii.gz`` - The apparent Proton Density map. No units.

*Important Options*

* ``--B1, -b``

    Specify an effective flip-angle or B1 map. This must be expressed as a fraction, e.g. a value of 1 in a voxel implies the nominal flip-angle was achieved.

* ``--algo, -a``

    This specifies which precise algorithm to use. There are 3 choices, classic linear least-squares (l), weighted linear least-squares (w), and non-linear least-squares (n). If you only have 2 flip-angles then LLS is the only meaningful choice. The other 2 choices should produce better (less noisy, more accurate) T1 maps when you have more input flip-angles. WLLS is faster than NLLS for the same number of iterations. However, modern processors are sufficiently powerful that the difference is bearable. Hence NLLS is recommended for the highest possible quality.

qi despot1hifi
-------------

This is an extension of DESPOT1 to fit a map simultaneously using an MP-RAGE / IR-SPGR type sequence. Although DESPOT1-HIFI can produce a rough estimate of B1, it often fails to produce reasonable values in the ventricles, and the fact that the MP-RAGE image is often acquired at lower resolution than the SPGR/FLASH data can also cause problems. Hence you should either smooth the B1 map produced as output, or fit it with a polynomial (:doc:`Utilities`), then recalculate T1 using the `qi despot1`_ command. Note that if your MP-RAGE image is not acquired at the same resolution as your SPGR data, it must be resampled to the same spacing before processing (and it should also be registered to your SPGR data).

**Example Command Line**

.. code-block:: bash

    qi despot1hifi spgr_file.nii.gz irspgr_file.nii.gz --mask=mask_file.nii.gz < input.json

**Example JSON File**

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "SPGR": {
            "TR": 0.01,
            "FA": [3, 18]
        },
        "MPRAGE": {
            "FA": 5,
            "TR": 0.01,
            "TI": 0.45,
            "TD": 0,
            "eta": 1,
            "ETL": 64,
            "k0": 0
        }
    }

For the MPRAGE sequence, the TR is the spacing between readouts/echoes, not the overall segment TR. TI is the Inversion Time, and TD is the Delay Time after the echo-train (often 0). Eta is the Inversion Efficiency, which should be set to 1. ETL is the Echo-Train Length - usually the number of phase encode steps in one segment. k0 defines the position in the echo-train that the center line of k-space is acquired. This is 0 for centric acquisition and ETL/2 for linear.

**Outputs**

* ``HIFI_T1.nii.gz`` - The T1 map. Units are the same as those used for TR in the input.
* ``HIFI_PD.nii.gz`` - The apparent Proton Density map. No units.
* ``HIFI_B1.nii.gz`` - The relative flip-angle map.

qi despot2
---------

DESPOT2 uses SSFP data and a separate T1 map to calculate T2, using the same maths as DESPOT1. It does not account for the banding artefacts present in SSFP data at field-strengths of 3T and above. See `qi despot2fm`_ for a method that does account for them, or if you have at least 4 phase-increments and complex data then see `qi ssfp_bands` in :doc:`Utilities` for a way to remove them before using this command.

.. image:: T2_slices.png
    :alt: A T2 map

**Example Command Line**

.. code-block:: bash

    qi despot2 t1_map.nii.gz input_file.nii.gz --mask=mask_file.nii.gz --B1=b1_file.nii.gz < input.json

**Example JSON File**

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "SSFP": {
            "TR": 0.005,
            "PhaseInc": [180],
            "FA": [12, 60]
        }
    }

Both ``PhaseInc`` and ``FA`` are measured in degrees. If the ellipse option is specified, then the sequence type must be ``SSFPGS``, which does not require a ``PhaseInc``. The units of ``TR`` must match the input T1 map.

**Outputs**

* ``D2_T2.nii.gz`` - The T2 map. Units are the same as those used for TR in the input.
* ``D2_PD.nii.gz`` - The apparent Proton Density map. No units. Will be corrected for T2 decay at the echo time.

*Important Options*

* ``--B1, -b``

    Specify an effective flip-angle or B1 map. This must be expressed as a fraction, e.g. a value of 1 in a voxel implies the nominal flip-angle was achieved.

* ``--algo, -a``

    This specifies which precise algorithm to use. There are 3 choices, classic linear least-squares (l), weighted linear least-squares (w), and non-linear least-squares (n). If you only have 2 flip-angles then LLS is the only meaningful choice. The other 2 choices should produce better (less noisy, more accurate) T1 maps when you have more input flip-angles. WLLS is faster than NLLS for the same number of iterations. However, modern processors are sufficiently powerful that the difference is bearable. Hence NLLS is recommended for the highest possible quality.

* ``--ellipse, -e``

    This specifies that the input data is the SSFP Ellipse Geometric Solution, i.e. that multiple phase-increment data has already been combined to produce band free images.

qi despot2fm
-----------

DESPOT2-FM uses SSFP data with mulitple phase-increments (also called phase-cycles or phase-cycling patterns) to produce T2 maps without banding artefacts.

**Example Command Line**

.. code-block:: bash

    qi despot2fm t1_map.nii.gz input_file.nii.gz --mask=mask_file.nii.gz --B1=b1_file.nii.gz < input.json

The input file should contain all SSFP images concatenated together as a 4D file. The preferred ordering is flip-angle, then phase-increment (i.e. all flip-angles at one phase-increment, then all flip-angles at the next phase-increment).

**Example JSON File**

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "SSFP": {
            "TR": 0.005,
            "PhaseInc": [180, 180, 0, 0],
            "FA": [12, 60, 12, 60]
        }
    }

Both ``PhaseInc`` and ``FA`` are measured in degrees. The length of ``PhaseInc`` and ``FA`` must match.

**Outputs**

* ``FM_T2.nii.gz`` - The T2 map. Units are the same as those used for TR in the input.
* ``FM_PD.nii.gz`` - The apparent Proton Density map. No units. Will be corrected for T2 decay at the echo time.

*Important Options*

* ``--B1, -b``

    Specify an effective flip-angle or B1 map. This must be expressed as a fraction, e.g. a value of 1 in a voxel implies the nominal flip-angle was achieved.

* ``--asym, -A``

    With the commonly used phase-increments of 180 and 0 degrees, due to symmetries in the SSFP magnitude profile, it is not possible to distinguish positive and negative off-resonance. Hence by default ``qi despot2fm`` only tries to fit for positive off-resonance frequences. If you acquire most phase-increments, e.g. 180, 0, 90 & 270, then add this switch to fit both negative and positive off-resonance frequencies.

qi jsr
-------------

Join-System Relaxometry fits T1 and T2 to spoiled and balanced gradient echo (SPGR and SSFP) data simultaneously, which improves the accuracy and precision in the fit of both.

**Example Command Line**

.. code-block:: bash

    qi jsr spgr.nii.gz ssfp.nii.gz < input.json

**Example JSON File**

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "SPGR": {
            "TR": 0.01,
            "TE": 0.003,
            "FA": [12]
        },
        "SSFP": {
            "TR": 0.01,
            "Trf": 0.003,
            "FA": [10, 20, 20, 40],
            "PhaseInc": [180, 180, 0, 180]
        }
    }

Note that the pulse-length for SSFP is required in order to apply to finite-pulse correction of Crooijmans et al. For hard-pulses this should be set to the actual length of the pulse, for other pulses an adjusted pulse-length is required as discussed in the paper.


**Outputs**

* ``JSR_PD.nii.gz`` - The apparent Proton Density map. No units.
* ``JSR_T1.nii.gz`` - The T1 map. Units are the same as those used for TR in the input.
* ``JSR_T2.nii.gz`` - The T2 map. Units are the same as those used for TR in the input.
* ``JSR_f0.nii.gz`` - The off-resonance map.

qi mcdespot
----------

Multi-component DESPOT aims to separate SPGR and SSFP signals into multiple discrete pools with different T1 and T2. In the brain, the pool with shorter values is attributed to myelin water, while pools with longer values can be either intra/extra-cellular water or CSF.

It is recommended to have an off-resonance map to stabilise the fitting. This can be generated by using `qi despot1`_ and then `qi despot2fm`_ above. A B1 map is also essential for good results.

.. image:: mcdespot.png
    :alt: Processed mcDESPOT Images

**Example Command Line**

.. code-block:: bash

    qi mcdespot spgr_file.nii.gz ssfp_file.nii.gz --mask=mask_file.nii.gz --B1=b1_file.nii.gz --f0=f0_file.nii.gz --scale < input.json

The SSFP input file should contain all SSFP images concatenated together as a 4D file (see `qi despot2fm`_ above).

**Example JSON File**

.. code-block:: json

    {
        {
            "SPGR": {
                "TR": 0.01,
                "FA": [3,4,5,7,9,12,15,18]
            }
        },
        {
            "SSFP": {
                "TR": 0.05,
                "FA": [12,16,20,24,30,40,50,60,12,16,20,24,30,40,50,60],
                "PhaseInc": [180,180,180,180,180,180,180,180,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
            }
        }
    }

**Outputs**

Note - the output prefix will change depending on the model selected (see below). The outputs listed here are for the 3 component model.

* ``3C_T1_m.nii.gz`` - T1 of myelin water
* ``3C_T2_m.nii.gz`` - T2 of myelin water
* ``3C_T1_ie.nii.gz`` - T1 of intra/extra-cellular water
* ``3C_T2_ie.nii.gz`` - T2 of intra/extra-cellular water
* ``3C_T1_csf.nii.gz`` - T1 of CSF
* ``3C_T2_csf.nii.gz`` - T2 of CSF
* ``3C_tau_m.nii.gz`` - The residence time of myelin water (reciprocal of forward exchange rate)
* ``3C_f_m.nii.gz`` - The Myelin Water Fraction (MWF)
* ``3C_f_csf.nii.gz`` - The CSF Fraction
* ``3C_f0.nii.gz`` - The off-resonance frequency. If this was specified on the command line, it will be a copy of that file
* ``3C_B1.nii.gz`` - The relative flip-angle map. If this was specified on the command line, it will be a copy of that file

The intra/extra-cellular water fraction is not output, as it is not a free parameter (only 2 of the 3 pool fractions are required for the calculations). It is easy to calculate this post-hoc by subtracting the MWF and CSFF from 1.

*Important Options*

* ``--algo, -a``

    * S - Stochastic Region Contraction
    * G - Gaussian Region Contraction
    
    Gaussian is recommended.

* ``--tesla, -t``

    Specify the field-strength so sensible fitting ranges can be used. Currently only ranges for (3) and (7)T are defined. If you wish to specify your own ranges, set this option as (u) and then the ranges will be read from your input file.

* ``--model, -m``
    * 1 - 1 component model (no fractions, just a single T1/T2)
    * 2 - 2 component model. Myelin and intra/extra-cellular water
    * 2nex - 2 component model without exchange
    * 3 - 3 component model. Myelin water, IE water & CSF
    * 3nex - 3 component model without exchange
    * 3f0 - 3 component model, allow an additional off-resonance offset between myelin and IE water pools

qi mp2rage
---------

MP2RAGE adds a second inversion time to the standard T1w MPRAGE sequence. Combining the (complex) images with the expression :math:`S_1 S_2^*/(|S_1^2 + S_2^2|)` produces a real-valued image that is corrected for receive coil (B1-) inhomogeneity. In addition, if the two inversion times are carefully selected, a one-to-one mapping exists between the values in that image and T1, which is also robust to transmit (B1+) inhomogeneity. Finally, as the two images are implicitly registered, this method has several advantages over DESPOT1.

**Example Command Line**

.. code-block:: bash

    qi mp2rage input_file.nii.gz --mask=mask_file.nii.gz < input.json

The input file must be complex-valued.

**Example JSON File**

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "MP2RAGE" : {
            "TR" : 0.006,
            "TRPrep" : 5,
            "TI" : [0.9, 2],
            "SegLength" : 128,
            "k0" : 64,
            "FA": [6, 8]
        }
    }

``TR`` is the readout or acquisition repetition time, while ``TRPrep`` is time between preparations/inversion pulses. ``SegLength`` is the number of readouts in one segment, and ``k0`` is the index within the segment when the center line of k-space is read. This is 0 for centric order, or :math:`SegLength / 2` for linear (default Siemens) order. There should be two values of ``TI`` and ``FA``.

**Outputs**

* ``{input}_contrast.nii.gz`` - The MP2 contrast image. The range of this image is -0.5 to 0.5.
* ``{input}_T1.nii.gz`` - The T1 map. Units are the same as `TR` and `SegTR`.

*Important Options*

* ``--beta, -b``

    Regularisation factor for robust contrast calculation (see references). It is recommended to experiment with this parameter to manually find an optimum value, which should then be kept constant for an entire dataset.

qi mpm_r2s
-----------

Implements the ECSTATICS method for estimating R2*, part of Multi-Parametric Mapping (MPM). This performs a simultaneous fit to PD-, T1- and MT-weighted multi-echo data for R2*, improving the SNR of the resulting fit compared to individual fits. In contrast to the original paper, which used linear least-squares, a bounded non-linear fit is used.

**Example Command Line**

.. code-block:: bash

    qi mpm_r2s PDw.nii.gz T1w.nii.gz MTw.nii.gz < input.json

**Example JSON File**

For regularly spaced echoes:

    {
        "PDw" : {
            "TR" : 2.5,
            "TE1" : 0.005,
            "ESP" : 0.005,
            "ETL" : 8

            "ETL" : 8
        },
        "MTw" : {

            "ESP" : 0.005,
            "ETL" : 6
        }
    }

``TE1`` is the first echo-time, ``ESP`` is the subsequent echo-spacing, ``ETL`` is the echo-train length.

**Outputs**

* ``MPM_R2s.nii.gz`` - The R2* map. Same units as ``TE``.
* ``MPM_S0_PDw.nii.gz`` - The PD-weighted signal at ``TE=0``.

qi ssfp_ellipse
---------------

This tool is not a relaxometry tool as such but a pre-processing step for `qi planet`_.
Shcherbakova et al showed it was possible to recover the ellipse parameters *G*, *a*, *b* from at least six phase-increments. They then proceeded to recover T1 & T2 from the ellipse parameters. This utility calculates the ellipse parameters, and ``qi planet`` then processes those parameters to calculate T1 & T2. A non-linear fit is used instead of the algebraic method used by Shcherbakova et al. This is slower, but robust across all flip-angles.

.. image:: ellipse.png
    :alt: SSFP Ellipse Parameters

**Example Command Line**

.. code-block:: bash

    qi ssfp_ellipse ssfp_data.nii.gz < input.json

The SSFP file must be complex-valued. At least three pairs of opposing phase-increments are recommended (six images in total).

**Example JSON File**

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "SSFP": {
            "TR": 0.005,
            "PhaseInc": [180, 240, 300, 0, 60, 120],
            "FA": [12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12]
        }
    }

Both ``PhaseInc`` and ``FA`` are measured in degrees. The length of ``PhaseInc`` and ``FA`` must match, but the value of ``FA`` is unused so a dummy value is permissible. If multiple ellipses with different flip-angles are present in the input data, do not specify the extra flip-angles.

**Outputs**

- ``ES_G`` - The Geometric Solution point of the ellipse. Influences the overall size of the ellipse. This is called \(M\) in the Hoff and Shcherbakova papers, but it is not a measurable magnetization and hence to distinguish it a different letter is used.
- ``ES_a`` - The ellipse parameter that along with \(G\) controls the ellipse size.
- ``ES_b`` - The ellipse parameter that determines how flat or circular the ellipse is.
- ``ES_theta_0`` - The accrued phase due to off-resonance, divide by :math:`2\pi TE` (or :math:`\pi TR`) to find the off-resonance frequency.
- ``ES_phi_rf`` - The effective phase of the RF pulse.
